random-stuff
---
this is literally just random stuff i code usually for experimentation not worth its own repo
may just be me practicing
or me learning something
and not wanting to dump the code instantly after i finish it

enjoy reading through my code i guess??

### other projects i made/have heavily contributed to but that arent here
