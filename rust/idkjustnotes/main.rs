    {
        let s = "hello" // (string literals are stored on the stack)
        // s is usable here, as expected
    } // s is not usable here, as expected

    // stores string on a heap, in case the value isnt known at compile time
    let mut s = String::from("hello") 
    s.push_str(", world!") // also means it can be mutable, unlike hardcoded strings

    // this thing is a bit weird yo
    // (ALL OF THE BELOW only applies to items on the heap, not on the stack - such as strings)
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    // when we declare this, the string itself is stored on the heap
    // however, on the stack: the pointer, length, and capacity (allocated space on the heap) are stored  
    let s2 = s1; // so when we declare this, it uses the same pointer, going to the EXACT same data
    s2[0] = "y" // this would change both s1 and s2, as they both point to the same thing
    // s1 is no longer considered valid after `let s2 = s1` to stop them both from trying to invalidate
    // explained better here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-02.svg
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // this line will instead "clone" it, causing them to point to seperate points of data
    // this is not a good thing to do, as it is very cpu and ram expensive

    // losing ownership
    let s = String::from("helloooooo") // this is in the heap, therefore:
    function(s) // s is no longer valid cuz it was "given" to the function
    let x = 5; // this is in the stack
    function(5); // therefore x still functions after this, as it is "copied", not "given" to the function

    // Borrowing ownership
    fn borrow(x: &i32) { 
        // (x: &mut i32) if we want it to be mutable
        // important limitation: can only have 1 mutable reference at a time
        x++
    }
    let /*mut*/ x = 0;
    borrow(&x); // or `borrow(&mut x)`
    x++; // doesnt throw an error, as x is still there, as it was only a reference
    // it was not passed to the function.
